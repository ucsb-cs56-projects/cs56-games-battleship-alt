cs56-games-battleship-alt
=========================

An alternative version of Battleship.    (Eventually, the two should be refactored into ONE.)

<b>TODO</b> - add more description to the sections of this README

This is a command line version of the game Battleship. 
* Original developer description - the Milton Bradley board game that has won the hearts of children for over four decades. It will be single-player (vs. computer) and will have various difficulty settings (easy, normal, hard).  You can also host/join games and play against your friends online WITH THE POWER OF JAVA NETWORKING!

The code can also be found at these links
