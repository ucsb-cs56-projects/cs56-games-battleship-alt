cs56-games-battleship-alt
=========================

An alternative version of Battleship.    (Eventually, the two should be refactored into ONE.)

<b>TODO</b> - add more description to the sections of this README

This is a simple GUI Battleship game that allows you to pick five boats and their orientation (horizontal points to left and vertical points upward), then play against a computer. To select a boat, click on the scroll box that says the name of the ship you want to place, then the button that you want to be the head of the ship on the grid (Try not to place ships that go out of bounds as that is causing errors).
Here are the ships and their appearance:

* Original developer description - the Milton Bradley board game that has won the hearts of children for over four decades. It will be single-player (vs. computer) and will have various difficulty settings (easy, normal, hard).  You can also host/join games and play against your friends online WITH THE POWER OF JAVA NETWORKING!

The code can also be found at these links
